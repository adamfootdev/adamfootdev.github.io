Since then I have worked on many projects that have been released on the App Store.</p><p>After finishing studying, I worked as an iOS developer at a startup for nearly four years.</p><p>In 2022, I left my job to become a full-time indie developer. I now spend most of my days building exciting apps for the App Store!</p><p>If thereʼs anything you need, please feel free to contact me <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Experience</h2><div class="about-minor-section"><h3>Indie Work (Self-Employed)</h3><p class="text-secondary about-experience-title">iOS Developer, January 2016 - Present</p><p>I started creating apps as a hobby after teaching myself iOS development with Swift. I have experience developing for all of Apple’s platforms using SwiftUI and in the past UIKit and AppKit too. The apps I build are quick to adopt new Apple APIs, such as Widgets and AppIntents more recently.</p><p>After working in a start-up environment full-time since 2018, I decided to quit my job to become an indie developer full-time in 2022.</p></div><div><h3>Redbox Mobile</h3><p class="text-secondary about-experience-title">Application Developer, June 2018 - February 2022</p><p>At Redbox Mobile, I was the sole iOS developer responsible for working on the ASO Toolkit app for iOS and macOS. This app was built entirely in SwiftUI and can be found <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1455829852" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Whilst working here, I had the experience of working with a number of globally recognised brands to improve their app’s ASO and helped to manage their Apple Search Ads campaigns. I became one of the first in Europe to achieve a certification in Apple Search Ads from Apple too.</p></div></div></div></div></div><footer><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamfootdev" target="_blank">X</a> | <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@adamfoot">Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamfoot04/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/adamfootdev" target="_blank">GitHub</a> | <a href="mailto:support@adamfoot.dev" target="_blank">Email</a></p><p>© Adam Foot | Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish" target="_blank">Publish</a></p></footer></body></html>
