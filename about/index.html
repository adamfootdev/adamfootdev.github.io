IÊ¼m an indie developer living in Swindon, UK building apps for iOS and other Apple platforms using Swift!

I started learning to build apps with Swift in 2015 as a hobby alongside school work. Since then I have worked on many projects that have been released on the App Store.

After finishing studying, I worked as an iOS developer at a startup for nearly four years.

In 2022, I left my job to become a full-time indie developer. I now spend most of my days building exciting apps for the App Store!

If thereÊ¼s anything you need, please feel free to contact me <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p></div><div class="about-section"><h2>Experience</h2><div class="about-minor-section"><h3 class="about-experience-title">Indie Work (Self-Employed)</h3><p class="text-secondary about-experience-subtitle">iOS Developer, January 2016 - Present</p><p>I started creating apps as a hobby after teaching myself iOS development with Swift. I have experience developing for all of Appleâ€™s platforms using SwiftUI and in the past UIKit and AppKit too. The apps I build are quick to adopt new Apple APIs, such as Widgets and AppIntents more recently.

After working in a start-up environment full-time since 2018, I decided to quit my job to become an indie developer full-time in 2022.</p></div><div><h3 class="about-experience-title">Redbox Mobile</h3><p class="text-secondary about-experience-subtitle">Application Developer, June 2018 - February 2022</p><p>At Redbox Mobile, I was the sole iOS developer responsible for working on the ASO Toolkit app for iOS and macOS. This app was built entirely in SwiftUI and can be found <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1455829852" target="_blank">here</a>.

Whilst working here, I had the experience of working with a number of globally recognised brands to improve their appâ€™s ASO and helped to manage their Apple Search Ads campaigns. I became one of the first in Europe to achieve a certification in Apple Search Ads from Apple too.</p></div></div><div><h2>Website</h2><p>This website was created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.</p></div></div></div></div><footer><p><a href="/press">Press</a> | <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> | <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a></p><p>Â© Adam Foot | VAT No: GB430563616</p></footer></body></html>
