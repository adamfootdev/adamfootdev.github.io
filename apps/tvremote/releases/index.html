TV Remote allows users to configure up to four commands to place in the Live Activity so that when they are watching television, they can quickly change channels, adjust volume and more without having to find the app again as it’s already on their Lock Screen or in the Dynamic Island.

The Live Activity can be started automatically or manually using the easy-to-access button in the top navigation bar. As well as this, a number of other settings can be configured such as the ability to use the TV’s theme or the TV Remote default, whether the theme options should apply to the Dynamic Island, and which commands are shown in the Live Activity Widget.

This feature requires access to TV Remote Premium, details of which can be found below or in the app.</p></div></div><div class="app-info-section"><h3>Version 2.1</h3><p class="secondary-paragraph">12 September 2022</p><div class="app-feature-row"><h4>Lock Screen Widgets</h4><p>Introduced in iOS 16, TV Remote will support Lock Screen Widgets.

The Complication to launch the app has now been built using WidgetKit so it’ll adapt much better to themes than in previous versions.</p></div><div class="app-feature-row"><h4>More</h4><p>As well as the main features, these are some of the other changes that are new or improved in version 2.1:

Now, in version 2, themes can be created for each individual television and there’s support for a different theme for Light and Dark Mode. Users are also able to toggle the app between Light &amp; Dark Mode or set it to Auto to match the system.

The themes created will now sync to Widgets and the Apple Watch app too instead of just the iPhone/iPad app as well. There’s also now a preview for users to see what their remote will look like without having to leave the screen.

TV Remote comes with a number of preset themes for specific devices and colour schemes which can also be duplicated and customised by the user themselves if they’re not quite satisfied with the default.</p></div><div class="app-feature-row"><h4>Layouts</h4><p>Brand new in version 2, the Layouts feature allows users to create a truly customisable remote control layout using some pre-defined components that were in version 1, and also some brand new ones too!

Each television can have its own unique layout and there’s support for customising the Apple Watch app’s layout too.</p></div><div class="app-feature-row"><h4>Widgets</h4><p>Widgets have been completely redesigned in version 2 with space for more remote commands, new sizes and as mentioned previously themes support too. Apps and Sources widgets are also brand new as well so watching content on the TV is quicker than ever.

Widgets now also close the app again when a command is pressed.</p></div><div class="app-feature-row"><h4>More</h4><p>As well as the main features, these are some of the other changes that are new or improved in version 2:
