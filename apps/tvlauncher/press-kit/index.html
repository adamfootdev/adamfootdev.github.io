TV Launcher integrates a full TV Guide with the ability to launch live channels across multiple streaming apps so users don’t have to hop between them.

There is support for notifications just before a programme starts, multiple Widgets, Shortcuts and an Apple Watch app for checking schedules too.

Iʼm an indie developer living in the UK building apps for iOS and other Apple platforms.Iʼve been building apps since 2015 and went full-time indie in 2022 after working at a startup for four years as an iOS developer.

Iʼve been using an Apple TV as my main source of media for a while now and have a few dotted around the house. Getting an aerial to some of these TVs was not easily possible so I decided to switch to using my Apple TV for live TV as well. The problem with this is that there is not a single unified TV guide in the UK for Apple TV so you have to go through each app individually to find something to watch.

So, I created TV Launcher. The app is simple to use and makes it easy for cord-cutters to find something to watch now or later. Many features have been added since release, including more countries, more platforms and support for widgets, Siri Shortcuts and the ability to be reminded before a programme starts.</p></div></div></div></div><footer><p><a href="/press">Press</a> | <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> | <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a></p><p>© Adam Foot | VAT No: GB430563616</p></footer></body></html>
